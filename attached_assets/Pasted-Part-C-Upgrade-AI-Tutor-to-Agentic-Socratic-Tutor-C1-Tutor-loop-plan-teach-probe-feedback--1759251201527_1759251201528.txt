Part C — Upgrade AI Tutor to Agentic Socratic Tutor
C1. Tutor loop (plan → teach → probe → feedback → adapt)

Lesson Planner: derives learning goal, prior knowledge check, Bloom level target. 
saskoer.ca

Instruction stage uses worked examples and segmentation to reduce cognitive load; switch to practice items.

Socratic probing: ask guiding questions; don’t reveal final answers until 1–2 attempts. 
Global Scientific Journal

Feedback: provide task/process/self-regulation level feedback per Hattie; actionable next step. 
Cambridge University Press & Assessment
+1

Adaptation: adjust difficulty (Bloom levels ↑/↓) based on correctness and confidence; log mastery state.

C2. Tutor prompt pack (add to PROMPTS.md)

System – “Teacher of Record”

“You are a patient, evidence-driven teacher. Use Socratic questions, worked examples, segmentation, and explicit feedback. Avoid giving solutions immediately. Cite sources when explaining substantive facts.” 
SpringerLink

Planner Template

Inputs: topic, grade, prior knowledge signal. Outputs: objectives, Bloom level, steps, checkpoints, resources. 
saskoer.ca

Probe Template

“Ask 1 question at a time; if incorrect, give process-level hint; if correct, raise Bloom level.” 
Cambridge University Press & Assessment

Feedback Template

“State what’s right/wrong; give next micro-step; offer retrieval prompt or mini-exercise.”

Part D — Code Tasks (concrete)

Create apps/api/src/agent/tools/search.ts and .../webFetch.ts with SSRF guards (protocol allow-list, reject private IPs, 10 MB cap, 5 s connect timeout).

Add apps/api/src/agent/orchestrator.ts (Planner/Act/Reflect loop; JSON tool schema).

Extend RAG service with verifyClaims(claims, snippets) and composeVerifiedAnswer(...).

Wire UI:

Chat panel shows “Verification Summary” drawer with per-claim status (Supported/Contradicted/Uncertain) and links.

Show doc citations (page/timecode) + web URLs.

Tutor: add apps/api/src/tutor/lessonPlanner.ts, probeEngine.ts, feedbackEngine.ts; expose /api/tutor/session that persists plan, attempts, mastery.

Env & Config: add WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER, WEB_SEARCH_KEY, FETCH_MAX_BYTES, FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS.

Rate-limit verification calls; cache web snippets per (query,host) for 10–30 minutes.

Part E — Tests & Demos

Unit:

verifyClaims.spec.ts (supported/contradicted/uncertain classification).

webFetch.spec.ts (SSRF: blocks private IPs, enforces size/time).

Integration:

Ask a question requiring off-doc facts; ensure answer includes web citations and verification statuses.

Tutor flow: plan → probe → feedback → mastery update; check it avoids immediate solution.

E2E (Playwright):

Upload small PDF → ask doc/source-mix question → see streaming answer + verification drawer populated.

Tutor: pick topic → answer 2 probes → see adaptive difficulty + feedback.

CI: add a “verify-agentic-rag” job; fail build on missing citations or failing SSRF tests.

Part F — Deliverables (must output)

PR with all code changes.

PROMPTS.md updated (Agentic RAG & Agentic Tutor sections).

SECURITY.md updated (web fetch SSRF policy).

DEMO_SCRIPTS.md with 2 scripted demos (Doc Chat verification; Tutor Socratic session).

Test report: pass summary for unit/integration/E2E.

ONE message at the end containing:

Summary of changes,

how to run,

and confirmation that all acceptance tests passed.

Guardrails

Snapshot (git tag) before edits; single PR at the end.

Strict timeouts on web tools; never fetch non-HTTP(S); never follow >2 redirects.

If verification fails, answer conservatively (state uncertainty).

Respect rate limits; exponential backoff.
