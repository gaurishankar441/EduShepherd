# Learning Plan: Recall and state Ohm's law (V = I × R) and what each symbol represents (V, I, R).

Learning Goals:
• Recall and state Ohm's law (V = I × R) and what each symbol represents (V, I, R).
• Recall the SI units for voltage (volt, V), current (ampere, A), and resistance (ohm, Ω), including common prefixes (milli-, kilo-).
• Recognize that for an ohmic conductor, voltage is proportional to current when resistance is constant.
• Rearrange V = IR to isolate any one variable in simple numeric cases.

Prior Knowledge Check:
Without looking anything up: list any electrical quantities you know (e.g., voltage, current, resistance) and their SI units. Briefly define one.

Learning Path:

1. PROBE (remember)
Quick diagnostic: 1) What is electric current and its unit? 2) What is voltage and its unit? 3) Which symbol represents resistance? 4) Have you ever built a simple circuit (battery–resistor–bulb)?
✓ Checkpoints: At least 70% can name two of the three quantities and one correct unit., Document misconceptions (e.g., 'current gets used up', confusing volts with amps) to address in the next step.

2. EXPLAIN (remember)
Introduce Ohm's law with minimal load: Core statement: For an ohmic conductor, the potential difference (V) across it equals the product of current (I) through it and its resistance (R): V = I × R. Symbols and units: V in volts (V), I in amperes (A), R in ohms (Ω). Proportionality: If R is constant, V ∝ I (a straight-line V–I graph through the origin). Notes: Some texts use E for voltage; in this lesson we use V. Emphasize typical prefixes: mA = 0.001 A, kΩ = 1000 Ω.
✓ Checkpoints: Students can write V = I × R and correctly label V, I, R and their SI units on mini whiteboards or paper., Thumbs check: Up if confident naming units; sideways if unsure; down if unfamiliar.

3. EXAMPLE (understand)
Worked examples (step-by-step, with units): Example 1 (solve for V): Given R = 4.7 Ω and I = 2.0 A, V = I × R = 2.0 A × 4.7 Ω = 9.4 V. Example 2 (solve for I): Given V = 12.0 V and R = 3.0 Ω, I = V ÷ R = 12.0 V ÷ 3.0 Ω = 4.0 A. Brief unit reasoning: A×Ω → V; V÷Ω → A. Highlight rearrangement triangle only after writing the algebra.
✓ Checkpoints: Cold-call: What equation do we start with? Which operation isolates I? Which units should the answer have?, Common error check: Students avoid mixing mA with A or kΩ with Ω without converting.

4. PRACTICE (apply)
Retrieval + one-step calculations: 1) Write Ohm's law from memory and label variables. 2) Match each quantity to its SI unit: voltage ( ), current ( ), resistance ( ). 3) Compute R if V = 9.0 V and I = 0.30 A. 4) A resistor has R = 220 Ω; current is 0.050 A. Find V. Encourage unit conversion if needed (e.g., 50 mA = 0.050 A).
✓ Checkpoints: Item 1: Formula and labels correct for at least 80% of learners., Item 2 answers: voltage→V, current→A, resistance→Ω., Item 3 target: R = 30 Ω; if not, revisit division and units., Item 4 target: V = 11 V; check that students convert mA to A when applicable.

5. REFLECTION (understand)
Exit slip (1–2 sentences): Complete the sentence: 'Ohm's law states that ______.' Then give one everyday example where knowing V, I, or R matters (e.g., choosing a phone charger or LED resistor).
✓ Checkpoints: At least 80% include the correct relation V = I × R or its verbal equivalent., Examples are plausible and connect to voltage/current/resistance (not power-only statements).

You responded to the prompt but skipped the actual task. In this step you should recall from memory: 1) a one-line definition of current + its SI unit, 2) a one-line definition of voltage + its SI unit, 3) the symbol for resistance, and 4) your prior experience with a simple circuit. A helpful process is to copy each question stem and complete it with a short, specific answer. If unsure, write your best guess and mark it with a question mark—this still gives us useful diagnostic information.
